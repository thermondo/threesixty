ThreeSixty is a tool to perform quantitative and unbiased [360-degree feedback][wiki-360] surveys.
It aims to be fun and scientific.

### Setup

Just click the button, duh!

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Thermondo/threesixty)

You are too lazy to come up with your own set of questions?
No problem we got you covered: [sample statements](https://github.com/Thermondo/threesixty-statements)

### Fun

ThreeSixty is a yes-no (polar) survey tool. You can simply answer questions by
swiping on your phone or using the arrow keys on a computer.

We also added cat pictures as rewards to keep participants happy.

### Science

360-degree surveys can be great tools when performed correctly.
If they are not, you risk that the recipients of constructive feedback
will not fully accept the feedback or worse go into
[denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial).

#### Reflection

ThreeSixty does not share the results directly with employees. They should be
only shared in a guided reflection session (1on1-meeting).
It is important to help the receiver to reflect on feedback to increase
chances of acceptance. The results should be also accompanied by proposed
actions. Those actions should help the employee to overcome weaknesses.

#### Confirmation Bias

ThreeSixty uses the same set of questions for all surveys.
Handpicking questions per employee will lead to biased results
since you will unconsciously select questions that confirm preexisting
assumptions.

As an added bonus you are able to compare results between employees.

#### Data Quality and Validity

ThreeSixty is a yes-no (polar) survey tool. This does not compromise your data
quality. Polar surveys can increase response rates and participant satisfaction.
This allows them to yield better results than other survey techniques.

Bear in mind that questions are not interpreted separately but as a whole for
a given attribute. You do not survey for individual statements but a small
set of attributes.

Please note that yes-no surveys are vulnerable to suggestibility.
To avoid this, we recommend to use the simplest form of a statement.
It should not include negations. This should be also taken into
account when reviewing a set of questions.

The effect can be eliminated by only evaluating standard deviation between all
employees.
